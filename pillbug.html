										<h2>Pillbug: PDF Breaker</h2>
										<p>A free PDF manipulation tool for accessibility.<br/></p>
									</header>

									<p>
										“Pillbug” is the name of a project that aims to be a free in-browser PDF 
										editor that edits the text of PDFs directly. PDFs are notoriously difficult to edit 
										in-place without having a PDF editor. Browser-based PDF editors are often blocked by a pay-wall,
										and nearly all of them only support adding onto a PDF document, 
										such as adding a signature or adding an additional page.
									</p>

									<p>
										Pillbug was born out of the need to remedy this issue. The goal of this project is to
										make PDFs, one of the most common document formats on the web, more accessible to 
										people with dyslexia, ADHD, convergence insufficiency, and everyone else in between.

									<h2>How does it work?</h2>

									<div data-position="left"><img src="images/diagram.png" alt="a diagram showing the flow of control when editing a document, first showing the uploaded pdf, then the pdf being edited in Pillbug, until finally the user downloads the edited PDF"></div>

									<p>
										First, choose the PDF you want to edit from your files. Next, edit the
										PDF to whatever specifications you would like (you can even upload your own font!). 
										Finally, save the PDF. And voila! It will appear in the same directory as your original file.
									</p>

									<p> 
										Please check out the repo to Pillbug <a href="https://github.com/a-wyrm/Pillbug-PDF-Breaker" target="_blank">here</a> 
										to keep track of the progress being made.
